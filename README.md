# NERVE Intelligence Platform

**The Unified Intelligence Platform for Security Professionals**

---

## Platform Overview

NERVE is a modular intelligence platform designed for penetration testers, security researchers, and threat intelligence analysts. It aggregates data from multiple sources to provide comprehensive attack surface analysis.

### The Five Modules

**Current Development:**
1. **GHOST** - Credential & Breach Intelligence *(In Development - Phase 1)*

**Planned Modules:**
2. **OPSYCH** - Social Engineering Intelligence *(Phase 2)*
3. **WATCHTOWER** - Physical & IoT Security *(Phase 3)*
4. **ORACLE** - Predictive Attack Intelligence *(Phase 4)*
5. **TBD** - Fifth module to be determined based on market needs

## Module 1: GHOST - Credential Intelligence

**Version:** 0.3.0  
**Status:** Active Development - Phase 1  
**Started:** October 22, 2025

### What is GHOST?

GHOST is a credential and breach intelligence module that aggregates data from breached databases, stolen credential repositories, and data leak sources. It provides security teams with visibility into compromised credentials that could be used against their organization or clients.

**Core Purpose:** Answer the question "Has this person/organization been compromised in a data breach?"

**Think:** Hudson Rock Cavalier + Resecurity breach intelligence

### GHOST Capabilities

**Current Features:**
- ‚úÖ Multi-source breach checking (local files, LeakCheck, BreachDirectory)
- ‚úÖ Automated risk scoring based on breach exposure
- ‚úÖ Profile management (create, search, delete)
- ‚úÖ Persistent SQLite database
- ‚úÖ Web-based interface
- ‚úÖ Data classification by sensitivity (passwords, financial, PII)

**Planned Features:**
- üîÑ Detailed profile view with breach timeline
- üîÑ Export to PDF/JSON
- üîÑ Bulk profile import (CSV)
- üîÑ Google dorking for exposed credentials
- üîÑ Automated daily rescans
- üîÑ Email notifications for new findings
- üîÑ Breach data correlation across profiles

### Data Sources

**Active (Free):**
- LeakCheck.io - Public API, no authentication
- BreachDirectory via RapidAPI - 500 requests/month free
- Local breach compilation files

**Documented (Requires API Key):**
- Have I Been Pwned - $3.50/month
- DeHashed - Paid credits required
- Snusbase - Paid service

**Planned:**
- Telegram bot monitoring for fresh breach releases
- Custom breach database with monthly updates
- Integration with botnet/stealer log sources

---

## Future Modules (Not Yet Started)

### Module 2: OPSYCH - Social Engineering Intelligence

**Purpose:** Human-centric threat intelligence - profile psychological vulnerabilities and social engineering attack surface

**Capabilities:**
- Email-based social media discovery (not just username)
- Phone number reverse lookup to social profiles
- Behavioral analysis and psychological profiling
- "Attacker View" digital twin simulation
- Social engineering scenario generation
- Engagement pattern analysis
- Face recognition social media discovery (PimEyes-style)

**Design Philosophy:** Replicate how an attacker profiles a human target, but for defensive purposes

**UI:** Black/gold aesthetic, radar scanner risk visualizations, attacker simulation dashboard

### Module 3: WATCHTOWER - Physical & IoT Security

**Purpose:** Map physical attack surface through exposed devices and network infrastructure

**Capabilities:**
- Shodan/Censys integration for exposed devices
- Camera feed discovery and location mapping
- IoT vulnerability identification
- Network device enumeration
- Physical security exposure scoring
- Corporate infrastructure mapping

### Module 4: ORACLE - Predictive Intelligence

**Purpose:** AI-powered prediction and automation layer across all modules

**Capabilities:**
- Attack scenario prediction ("What will attacker do next?")
- Pattern recognition across GHOST, OPSYCH, WATCHTOWER
- Automated playbook generation
- Risk trend analysis
- Proactive threat hunting suggestions
- Integration into all other modules as predictive layer

### Module 5: TBD

**Options Under Consideration:**
- **DOCKET** - Court records and legal intelligence
- **FININT** - Financial transaction intelligence
- **GEOINT** - Physical location tracking and movement patterns
- **SIGINT** - Communication intercepts (enterprise/gov only)

Decision based on market research and customer needs.
